he growing concern for data privacy, particularly in the medical domain, underscores the necessity of encrypting sensitive medical information to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) proposes a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring privacy while allowing for meaningful analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework for securely calculating the mean blood pressure (MBP) and categorizing the patientâ€™s BP level, a critical health indicator, using the Paillier cryptosystem. The framework includes components such as a lexer for tokenizing medical text, a parser for examining tokens, and the implementation of Paillier encryption for secure computation. Through encryption, computation, and subsequent decryption, the MBP and the BP levels are derived without compromising data privacy.
